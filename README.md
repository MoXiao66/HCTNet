We compared the feature maps of sub-backbone and the fused feature map, 
as shown in the figure. By examining the feature maps, we can observe that 
features at different scales contain distinct information. The fusion of 
these multi-scale features aids us in more effectively extracting road details. 
In the fused feature map, we can clearly see the overall contour of the road.
